# üèóÔ∏è Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction and Optimization

## About

Use Case: XYZ Cement Factory is a leading manufacturer of cement products. Recently, the company has received feedback from its clients about the inconsistent strength of its cement. To maintain its reputation and ensure customer satisfaction, XYZ Cement Factory has decided to invest in optimizing the cement strength.

Goal: Predict the compressive strength of concrete based on the mixture of ingredients and optimize the mixture of ingredients to maximize the compressive strength of concrete.
